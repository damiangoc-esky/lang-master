# Step 7: CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview
This document provides detailed instructions for setting up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate build and deployment processes.

## Instructions

### Set Up GitHub Actions
1. **Create a GitHub Repository**:
   - Push your project code to a new GitHub repository.
2. **Create a GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   - In your repository, navigate to the "Actions" tab.
   - Click "New workflow" and select a template or create a custom workflow.
   - Define jobs for building, testing, and deploying your application.

### Example Workflow
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up .NET
        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1
        with:
          dotnet-version: '3.1.x'
      - name: Build
        run: dotnet build

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Deploy to Google Cloud
        run: |
          gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file ${{ secrets.GCP_KEY }}
          gcloud app deploy
```

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you will have a CI/CD pipeline set up using GitHub Actions, automating the build and deployment processes for the Language Learning App.
