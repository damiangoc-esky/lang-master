# App Planning Document

## Project Overview
This document provides a comprehensive plan for building the Language Learning App, detailing project decisions, main requirements, and potential case studies of usage.

## Project Decisions
- **Technology Stack**: The backend will be developed using C# .NET Core for its robust performance and scalability. The frontend will utilize Angular for its powerful component-based architecture and ease of integration with RESTful APIs.
- **Database**: Google Cloud SQL will be used for its reliability and support for complex queries, which are essential for managing language learning content and user data.
- **Deployment**: The application will be hosted on Google Cloud to ensure scalability and availability.

## Main Requirements
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system with support for social media logins.
- **Content Management**: Admin interface for managing words, phrases, and lessons.
- **Data Insertion**: Support for uploading a CSV file with Polish words and their English translations to populate the database.
- **Learning Modules**: Interactive modules for memo technique learning and sentence building.
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time analytics and feedback on user progress.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the app is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Case Studies
### Case Study 1: Beginner Language Learner
- **Profile**: A user new to the language, looking to build vocabulary and basic sentence structure.
- **Usage**: Utilizes the memo technique to memorize common words and phrases, and practices sentence building to improve grammar.

### Case Study 2: Intermediate Learner
